#Predicitve Maintenance with Machine Learning
This project aims to apply techniques of machine learning to predict machine failures using the A4I4 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset.
The goal is to build a classification model that can detect whether will fail and help reduce downtime that is unplanned.

## Project Steps
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train - test split
- Feature scaling
- Model training
- Model evaluation
---
## Models Used
- RandomForestClassifier (optional)
- Logistic Regression
---
## Results
- The model succesfully predicts failures based on measurements of sensors such as torque, temperature, tool wear and rotational speed.
- Metrics of evaluation include accuracy and classification report.
## Ethical Note
This projectwas inspired from public Kaggle notebooks.
The implementation, explanations and structure were modified and recreated for learning purposes.
